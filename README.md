<h4>--> Easy way to build a demo app from php code snippets and scripts. <-- </h4>

Creating a prototype from snippets can be a daunting UI task. <br>
But with a few simple steps, you can quickly assemble a demo app from php code snippets and scripts. <br><br>
Download the index.php file and create a folder in the same directory - for example, name it ‘tools’. <br>
In this folder, you can store your small scripts and organize them into subfolders. <br><br>
When you call the index.php in the parent folder, all the subfolders of the ‘tools’ folder will be displayed in a drop-down menu, ready for you to explore. The advantage is that whenever you create a new script or folder, the menu is automatically updated - making it easier for you to navigate your applications. <br>
