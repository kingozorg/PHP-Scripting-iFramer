Easy way to build a demo app from php code snippets and scripts.

How it works: <br>
Just download the index.php file and create a folder in the same directory, e.g. with the name "tools". 
In this folder you can now create as many subfolders as you want and store and sort your small scripts in them. 
If you now call the index.php in the folder above, all subfolders of the folder "tools" are displayed 
and you can easily and quickly jump between your scripts via a drop-down menu. 

The advantage:<br> 
Whenever you create a script or a new folder, the menu is updated automatically.
